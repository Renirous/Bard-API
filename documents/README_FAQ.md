The error you're experiencing isn't originating from the package itself; it's related to your Google account and may be due to various factors like your country or region settings, which can prevent you from receiving accurate results from Bard. Therefore, it's beyond the scope of the package to resolve, but please consider checking the following:

1. First, thoroughly read the readme and see if it pertains to cases of temporary abnormal responses from the package. Try again after some time or a few hours: [Before using Bard API](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/blob/main/README.md#before-using-the-bard-api)
2. Bypass proxies: [Behind a proxy](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API#behind-a-proxy)
3. Try using an account from a different region or change the language settings of your Google account.
4. Restart your browser to refresh the cookie values and use the new __Secure-1PSID.
5. Try passing three or more cookies using [Multi-cookie Bard](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/blob/main/documents/README_DEV.md#multi-cookie-bard). If that doesn't work, consider passing almost all cookie values.

Please let me know if you need further assistance.
